# Application Key Bindings

This document outlines the key bindings used in the application to control model behavior. These controls allow you to switch between models, translate, rotate, and scale the current model in the scene.

## Model Switching
- **Spacebar (`K_SPACE`)**: Switches to the next model in the list.

## Translation (Movement) Controls
- **Left Arrow (`K_LEFT`)**: Moves the current model left along the x-axis.
- **Right Arrow (`K_RIGHT`)**: Moves the current model right along the x-axis.
- **Up Arrow (`K_UP`)**: Moves the current model up along the y-axis.
- **Down Arrow (`K_DOWN`)**: Moves the current model down along the y-axis.
- **Page Up (`K_1`)**: Moves the current model closer along the z-axis.
- **Page Down (`K_2`)**: Moves the current model further along the z-axis.

## Rotation Controls
- **A (`K_a`)**: Rotates the current model counter-clockwise around the x-axis.
- **D (`K_d`)**: Rotates the current model clockwise around the x-axis.
- **W (`K_w`)**: Rotates the current model counter-clockwise around the y-axis.
- **S (`K_s`)**: Rotates the current model clockwise around the y-axis.
- **Q (`K_q`)**: Rotates the current model counter-clockwise around the z-axis.
- **E (`K_e`)**: Rotates the current model clockwise around the z-axis.

## Scaling Controls
- **Minus (`K_MINUS`)**: Scales down the current model uniformly.
- **Equals (`K_EQUALS`)**: Scales up the current model uniformly.
